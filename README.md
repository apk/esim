This is retro-ware, a railway simulator I wrote a long time ago,
and then gradually added more tracks and trains to.
It runs theoretically unattended, and on an X display, but
it will run into some deadlock situations of varied ease
of being fixable.

It used a proprietary comm lib whose use has been ripped out,
and a similarly proprietary build system which is the reason
nothing but the newest commits will build at all.
